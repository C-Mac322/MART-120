	There are two different interface designs that allow one to interact with directories and files as it applies to coding and programming. These being the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and the Command Line Interfaces (CLI). The differences between a GUI and CLI are not strictly cosmetic, although it may initially appear to be. GUIs are much more presentable, especially to those who may not be as adept when navigating and manipulating computers as career programmers and developers. GUIs often utilize a significant amount of mouse inputs to navigate and are organized in a way similar to a filing cabinet, desk, or another way of physical information storage. For these reasons, GUIs can be very intuitive and convenient. However, where GUIs may have an advantage in ease-of-access, CLIs have an advantage in control.
	CLIs utilize commands that allow the user to directly tell the computer what the user would like to do, where to go, or what information the user is after. CLIs can also provide more information at once, since, unlike GUIs, CLIs are not designed to present information in a graphically pleasing way necessarily. CLIs are more concerned with giving out the information first and allowing for more user control. This, consequently, means that CLIs require the user to be aware of specific commands in order to use the interface to its full capability, while GUIs do not, since the navigation and control information is deliberately and neatly presented to the user.
	While GUIs and CLIs both have their advantages and disadvantages, their capability is much the same. GUIs main strength is accessibility with a lack of control and CLIs strength is control with a lack of accessibility. These considerations may make preference boil down to either expertise or lack thereof.
