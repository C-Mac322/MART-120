	<h1>One of my favorite stories</h1>
	<h3>Summary -</h3>
	<p>The tale of <i>For Honor</i>, where a vicious warlord known as Apollyon wages war against anyone who she deems a "sheep". She demands that people fight one another until the bitter end. Her interesting morals are delved into throughout the events of the game, where it brings up her ideas of "wolves vs. sheep" and how she claims that war is the natural state of humanity; a wholly interesting idea itself. If this was not already intensely interesting, it uses a fantasic historical fictional setting as its set dressing - European Knights, Japanese Samurai and Scandanvian "Vikings" all pitted against one another in a legendary historical battle. It's what <i>Deadliest Warrior</i> wishes it could be.</p>
